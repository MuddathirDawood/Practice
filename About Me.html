   <h1>Some information about me</h1>
   <h2>Background</h2> 
     <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        My name is Muddathir Dawood and i'm 18 years old. I matriculated in 2021 at Spine Road High School
        and the subject pack I took is I.T where I learned the programing language Pascal and I did a bit of
        SQL.
    </p>
    <h2>What I am aiming for now</h2>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        I am currently at a 12 month Coding course at Life Choices Academy in Cape Town, South Africa where we will be taught 
        various programming languages such as HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, MySQL, NodeJS, VueJs, JavaScript and more. This course will 
        allow me to become a step closer to becoming a Full Stack Developer.
